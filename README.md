# The bioconda channel

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/galaxyproject/conda-iuc.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/galaxyproject/conda-iuc)

[Conda](https://conda.io/) is a platform- and language-independent package
manager that sports easy distribution, installation and version management of
software.  The [IUC channel](https://anaconda.org/iuc) is a conda
channel providing packages useful for Galaxy tools.  This repository hosts the
corresponding recipes.

The IUC highly recommends to submit packages to [Bioconda](https://bioconda.github.io/) or [conda-forge](https://conda-forge.org/), which are used by Galaxy in its standard configuration.

This repository contains conda packages that are migrated from traditional Galaxy tool dependencies or
packages that cannot be submitted to Bioconda and conda-forge for various reasons.
